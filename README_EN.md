## Authentication & Authorization

To use Invex, you must first obtain API credentials. This process involves providing basic contact information, agreeing to our terms and conditions, and completing identity verification procedures. Once approved, you'll receive an API key pair consisting of a public key, an API key to use in the header (**X-API-Key-Invex**), and a secret key.

**Note:** Your API key serves as a secure identifier, allowing you to sign requests and verify your identity. It's essential to keep your API key confidential; never share it with anyone outside of authorized personnel. If you suspect unauthorized activity or compromise, notify our support team immediately or revoke your API key using your dashboard.

Additionally, Invex implements several security measures to protect against malicious activities:

- **Encryption Protocols**: All communication between servers and client applications utilizes industry-standard TLS v1.2+ encryption.
- **Rate Limits**: To prevent abuse, we impose strict rate limits on certain endpoints.
- **Replay Attacks Prevention**: Our systems detect and block attempts to reuse previously sent messages.

##### How to sign input data?

For each endpoint with input data, you should sign your input data. To do so, you need to provide an `expire_at` field in your query parameters or request body. Take a look at the example in the following requests. But how to sign your data?

Here is a sample code in Python:

```python
import binascii
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import load_der_private_key
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

def sign_using_private_key():
    private_key = ... # secret key of your API key
    message = ... # JSON decoded user input data, including expire_at
    byte_private_key = binascii.unhexlify(private_key)
    rsa_private_key = load_der_private_key(byte_private_key, password=None)
    signature = rsa_private_key.sign(
        message.encode(),
        padding.PSS(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
            salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
        ),
        hashes.SHA256()
    )
    return signature.hex()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(sign_using_private_key())
```

Use the output as the signature for your request call.

Scopes play a crucial role in determining which actions you may perform within the platform. Each scope represents a set of permissions granted to your API key. For instance, the `trade` scope allows placing and modifying orders, whereas the `read` scope restricts access to read-only operations.

When creating an API key, specify one or more scopes according to your intended use case. The following table summarizes commonly used scopes:

| Scope | Description | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trade | Place and cancel orders | Create, delete orders |
| read | Read-only access to account information | View account history, positions |

---

## Trading Endpoints

You can place both limit and market orders, specifying quantity, side (buy/sell), and optionally, price.

Order placement occurs through the `/orders` endpoint, accepting POST requests containing JSON payloads. Upon successful submission, you'll receive a response confirming the order ID.

Market orders are executed instantly, subject to market conditions. Limit orders remain open until filled or cancelled.

Trade execution follows a standard procedure:

1. Client submits an order.
2. Matching Engine searches for suitable counterparties.
3. Counterparties agree upon settlement terms.
4. Transaction is recorded in ledgers.
5. Funds transferred accordingly.

## Market Rules Endpoint

Before executing trades, review the market rules governing each symbol. These regulations determine tick sizes, amount_step_size, and minimum/maximum order values. Use the `/markets` endpoint to retrieve current configurations.

Example Response:

```json
{
    "symbol": "USDT_IRR",
    "tick_size": "10.000000000000000000",
    "amount_step_size": "0.010000000000000000",
    "minimum_limit_order_value": "1000000.000000000000000000",
    "maximum_limit_order_value": "10000000000.000000000000000000"
}
```

Note that market rules may change dynamically due to factors such as volatility, news events, or regulatory interventions. Always check the most recent configurations prior to executing trades.
